<p>Construction is a general term meaning the art and science of forming objects, systems, or organizations. It comes from the Latin word constructio (from com- "together" and struere "to pile up") and Old French construction.</p>
<p>In its most widely used context, construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings, infrastructure, industrial facilities, and associated activities through to the end of their life. <strong>It typically starts with <u>planning, financing, and design</u> that continues until the asset is built and ready for use.</strong></p></body>
