<h2>Planning</h2>

<p>When applicable, a proposed construction project must comply with local land-use planning policies including zoning and building code requirements. <strong>A project will normally be assessed <u>(by the 'authority having jurisdiction, AHJ, typically the municipality where the project will be located)</u> for its potential impacts on neighbouring properties, and upon existing infrastructure</strong> (transportation, social infrastructure, and utilities including water supply, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications, etc.).</p>
<p>During the construction of a building, a municipal building inspector usually inspects the ongoing work periodically to ensure that construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code. Once construction is complete, any later changes made to a building or other asset that affect safety, including its use, expansion, structural integrity, and fire protection, usually require municipality approval.</p></body>
