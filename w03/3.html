<p>Once contractors and other relevant professionals have been appointed and designs are sufficiently advanced, work may commence on the project site. Typically, <strong>a construction site will include a secure perimeter <u>to restrict unauthorised access, site access control points, office and welfare accommodation</u> for personnel</strong> from the main contractor and other firms involved in the project team, and storage areas for materials, machinery and equipment.</p>
<p>According to the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Architecture and Construction's definition, construction may be said to have started when the first feature of the permanent structure has been put in place, such as pile driving, or the pouring of slabs or footings.</p></body>
